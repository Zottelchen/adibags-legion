# AdiBags - Legion

**Adds multiple (optionally colored) categories for the most common Legion items in AdiBags (AdiBags is required!):**

* Artifact Power (disabled by default, because they are now grey items and have no purpose but selling them)
* Ancient Mana
* Artifact Relics
* Champion Equipment
* Champion Upgrades
* Bait (disabled by default)
* Rare Fish (disabled by default)
* Legion Reputation items
* Broken Shore items

If anything is missing, misplaced, or you want a new category, then please write a comment or [open an issue](https://github.com/Zottelchen/adibags-legion/issues).
